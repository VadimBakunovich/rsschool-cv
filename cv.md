## About me

I like solving small problems on the way to a big goal. When building web applications, it's nice to know that you are making the world at least a little bit better by helping people. In my work, I am guided by very important rules: create a favorable atmosphere around you, help colleagues, be honest and disciplined, constantly improve your qualifications.
